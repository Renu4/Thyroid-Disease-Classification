# Thyroid-Disease-Classification
The task here is to predict if a patient is normal or hypothyroid or hyperthyroid (i.e. 3 output categories).
Hypothyroidism occurs when the gland is underactive. producing too less thyroid hormone.
Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid is overactive, producing too much thyroid hormone. There are
7200 observations representing patients.  5000 of these are for training, and 2200 are withheld for
testing. There are 21 variables. The data is given the file thyroidTrain.mat
